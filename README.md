Hello there! This is a Quicksort algorithm that sorts the data in an array in Java.

I strongly believe that a Quicksort algorithm is a must-have pet-project for every computer science student. 
It is especially important to understand for the Java developers since the default sorting algorithm in Java (Arrays.sort) is also Quicksort.

It is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. Which means that it picks one element of an array as the pivot and sorts all the other elements around it. The way I implemented it here is that smaller elements are moved to the left and larger to the right of the pivot
There are many different ways to choose the pivot in the Quicksort algorithm. In my program it is always the last element of the array. 

The current program has 2 features:

1. a user can set the length of an array that is than filled with the random numbers
2. this array is then showed unsorted and moments later sorted in ascending order


Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
